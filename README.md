The Project is about the 《Transfer Learning-assisted Computational Screening of Metal-Organic Frameworks and Covalent-Organic Frameworks for the separation of Xe/Kr noble gas》
There are three parts

1.feature building
  we building the program about the AP-RDF and Voronoi energy calculation. Obtain it from the feature_building.
  "dealproject.ARrdf()" get the parameters of AP-RDF. 
  "dealproject.Grid()" get the parameters of voronoi energy. 
  "grid_finish()" and "rdf_finish()" are get the finish result. 

2.BayessearchCV
  The model parameters has been built in Bayesian search. You can get the program in the file of BayesSearch.

3.Features & Predicted
  You can obtain the databases in Data/Data-norm.
